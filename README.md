# Self-Normalization for Locally Stationary Time Series

This repository contains the code for the methods and experiments presented in the paper titled:

Title: Self-Normalization for CUSUM-based Change Detection in Locally Stationary Time Series

Author(s): Florian Heinrichs

### Overview

This repository includes code for the different tests, simulation (data generation and experiments) and case studies.

### Requirements

To use the proposed methods, only NumPy and SciPy are required. Additional Python packages are required for the real data applications.

### Usage

The high-level functions implementing the proposed tests are defined in `self_normalization.py`.

### Datasets

The datasets used for evaluation in the paper are available for download here:
- [Consumer-Grade EEG and Eye-Tracking Dataset](https://zenodo.org/records/14860668) ([Python Code](https://github.com/FlorianHeinrichs/eeg_eye_tracking))
- [Climate Data Onlien - Bureau of Meteorology (Australian Government)](https://www.bom.gov.au/climate/data/index.shtml)
